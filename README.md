## WP plugin for block schedules ##
So the plan here is to add a couple of pages:
  * View your upcoming schedule monthly
  * Block off time on your schedule with a reason (doesn't require approval by anyone)
  * View schedule of chosen member (either from link in their profile or a search box on the schedule page)
  * Request block of time from other user (requires their approval)

I'll try to remember to strike through that list as I manage to create the functionality. The main reason for this repo is to easily share my codebase with my lovely gf @senkarose so she can work with me on it.
